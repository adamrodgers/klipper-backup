#   Beacon trigger distance for homing.

#   Hysteresis on trigger threshold for untriggering, as a percentage of the
#   trigger threshold.

#   Minimum z bound on sensor response measurement.

#   Name of default beacon model to load.
mesh_main_direction: x
#   Primary travel direction during mesh measurement.
#mesh_overscan: -1
#   Distance to use for direction changes at mesh line ends. Omit this setting
#   and a default will be calculated from line spacing and available travel.

#   Radius of mesh grid point clusters.
mesh_runs: 2
#   Number of passes to make during mesh scan.
zero_reference_cluster_size: 1.
#   Radius of cluster used for zero reference position, this is the equivalent
#   of mesh_cluster_size for the zero reference position.
accel_scale: 16g
#   Adjust the sensitivity of the accelerometer during shaper measurement,
#   valid settings on RevH are 16g, 8g, 4g and 2g.
accel_axes_map: -x, -y, z
#   Reassign or invert axes of the accelerometer to align with machine coordinates.

default_probe_method: proximity
# Sets the default probing method for mesh, tilt, qgl, probe, etc.
contact_max_hotend_temperature: 190 # increase to enable hot contacting
# Temperature limit for the hotend when contacting, override this for temps which may damage some surfaces.
contact_sensitivity: 0
# Adjusts noise tolerance of contact processing. Values 0-3 are valid, with 3 tolerating the most noise.

# Limits how low of a latency contact is allowed to advance.

# new additions for beacon safe_z_home functionality

home_y_before_x: False
# If set, the Y axis will home first when using the beacon safe_z_home

# new additions for setting default homing mode
home_method: contact
# Sets default homing method used by G28. `proximity` requires a valid beacon model to be loaded.
home_method_when_homed: proximity # defaults to `home_method` value
# Sets the homing method when the machine is already in a homed state.
home_autocalibrate: always
# Sets the autocalibration behavior. `always` will autocal on every home, `unhomed` on initial homing,
# `never` will never so that models stored in config may be used with proximity homing.

#home_gcode_pre_x: _HOME_PRE_AXIS AXIS=X
